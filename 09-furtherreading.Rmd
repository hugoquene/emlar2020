# Further reading {#sec:furtherreading}

A wealth of useful documentation is available through the `Help` tab
in the lower right pane of RStudio. Browse in the FAQ files, the help files, the
manuals and the vignettes that come with R and Rstudio. 

More help can be called from within R by giving the command
`help(ABC)` or `?ABC` with a
command or operator as argument. 
(This can be typed in the `Console` tab in the lower left pane of RStudio.)

There is also a lot more help available on the internet, in particular
from the R project website <https://www.r-project.org>
and the RStudio website <https://www.Rstudio.com>.

A few other useful web resources are:

-   Quick-R, <http://statmethods.net>

-   <http://math.illinoisstate.edu/dhkim/Rstuff/Rtutor.html>

The following three books on using R and on its
applications in linguistics are highly recommended:

Happy analyses!
